## Why are we doing this
Thank you for your interest in the open source projects at Karakun.
We believe that contributing to open source should be as easy as possible.
Therefore we are always open for new contributors and ready to assist if you need help in achieving your goal.

Never the less there is also a legal side to source code.
And simply adding an open source license to a repository is not sufficient.
We all would love if it would be that straight forward.

In order to accept your contribution we must make sure, that you are the owner of the copyright and you are willing to grant your copyright and your patent license to the open source project.

## Individual CLA
If you are the owner of the copyright of your contribution then please fill out the **[Individual Contributor License Agreement]({{"/assets/cla/IndividualContributorLicenseAgreement.pdf"}})**.

## Corporate CLA
If the copyright to your contribution is owned by a third party (such as an employer) by operation of law, agreement or otherwise then please have the **[Corporate Contributor License Agreement]({{"/assets/cla/CorporateContributorLicenseAgreement.pdf"}})** filled out by the third part.
