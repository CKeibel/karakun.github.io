- name: 'Progressive Web Apps mit der Service Worker API'
  author: 'simon'
  summary: >
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) bridge the gap between websites and native applications. 
They combine the high accessibility of web pages with the open standards of the web in terms of 
Look and feel (HTML, CSS), search engine optimization (SEO) and functionality (Push API, Notification API), 
Web Storage API, HTTPS etc.) with some properties of native applications. So Progressive 
Web Apps offline (Service Worker API) and from the Home Screen (Web App Manifest).

This talk shows how to create a PWA. The focus is on the Service Worker API, 
which plays a central role for Progressive Web Apps. It will also show how the Web 
App manifest and which tools help to realize a PWA.

- name: 'Java APIs - The missing manual'
  author: 'hendrik'
  summary: >
    This isn’t a talk about microservices, NoSQL, container solutions or hip new frameworks. 
    This talk will show some of the standard Java APIs that are part of Java since version 5, 6, 7 or 8.
    All those features are very helpful to create maintainable and future-proof applications, regardless
    of whether JavaEE, Spring, JavaFX or any other framework is used. The talk will give an overview of
    some important standard concepts and APIs of Java like annotations, null values and concurrency.
    Based on an overview of this topics and some samples the talk will answer questions like: 

    - How can I create my own annotations? 
    
    - How can I create a plugin structure without using frameworks like OSGI? 
    
    - What’s the best way to handle NullPointerExceptions? 
    
    - How can I write concurrent code that is still maintainable?

- name: 'Multidevice Controls: A Different Approach to UX'
  author: 'gerrit'
  summary: >
    Everybody knows boring form-based user interfaces. What if you could add mobile devices to improve 
    the UX of desktop or web applications? A research project at the University of Applied Sciences and 
    Arts Northwestern Switzerland has tried to address this topic in a totally different way. Usually you 
    would expect to rework the UI and make it fancier, but here the idea is to enhance controls so they 
    can reside on a mobile device. For example, you can think about a text input field that gets the focus, 
    with the actual data input being done on a mobile phone. This session presents an overview of the concept 
    and shows you some results of the research project in the form of demos based on Swift, JavaFX, and Polymer.

- name: 'The path to CD: End-to-End with Docker and Geb'
  author: 'markus'
  summary: >
    End to end testing is a crucial part of a tool chain to deliver high-quality releases of many software systems.
    
    With Geb, we have a very handy wrapper to WebDriver/Selenium at our fingertips that enables us to create actually maintainable E2E test suites even for large web applications.
    Combining it with Docker and a CI system enables us to be very flexible about the context we use this tests in and allow us to provoke feedback for many interesting aspects we need to know about in our system.

    This talk outlines findings and experiences from projects that utilized the mentioned technologies to succeed in constantly delivering high quality releases not only in slides but also with some live-coding and demos.

- name: 'The secret behind JWT'
  author: 'markus'
  summary: >
    In the age of micro services and applications that are build from many distributed components and need to take care for aspects like CSRF and CORS, session cookies are not practicable anymore.

    Tokens promise to be a silverbullet. JWT (JSON Web Token) aims to simplify the usage of authentication tokens in modern application landscapes.

    This talks shows if tokens can fulfill that promise and keep up the web applications taste even when cookies are missing.

- name: 'Java WebStart is dead - What should we do now?'
  author: 'hendrik'
  summary: > 
    Starting with Java 11, WebStart is being removed from Java. 
    Because even today several applications are built on top of this technology, 
    it will be mission-critical for many companies to find a replacement for it. 
    This session presents an overview of the features of WebStart and how they can be replaced. 
    It includes samples of several open source and commercial tools that provide such features 
    and might mean new and cool possibilities for WebStart-based applications.

- name: 'Where the wild projects are'
  author: 'hendrik'
  summary: >
    Build and testing a commercial software is easy. You can use a big infrastructure for CI and commercial tools to test your complete stack. And if you want to test your application on different mobile devices - well, that's easy! You company will buy them for you. But what can you do if you want to work on Open Source? You can not spend thousands of Dollars for a free time project and without a given infrastructure several build, test and deployment steps are just impossible... 
    Imagine a world in that testing, building or deploying of open source software is at least as easy as for commercial projects. Maybe it's just easier and the infrastructure is better than in most $$$ stacks. I will introduce you to this world and show several tools and services that will help you to get the best out of your open source project - without producing any costs but with a lot of fun, cool new technologies and the freedom of choose.

- name: 'Polyglott Java - a platform for many paradigms'
  author: 'mittie'
  summary: >
    There are many ways to program - and all of them find a home on the JVM. Whether you are a die-hard object-oriented enterprise programmer, a super-cool scripting hipster, or a scientific functional engineer, the Java Platform has all you need.
    In this talk we will go through unconventional combinations of these paradigms that enrich your solution space - scripting user-defined functions for a business application, building ambitious user interfaces, and creating rock-solid transaction systems.
    Java has something for everybody.
