## Love where you work
At Karakun, we always look for talented people to do work that they love, at all levels of the company.
Karakun has a team of more than 30 very experienced software developers that have been working together for many years. The Karakun team develops custom solutions in an agile way for enterprises of different industries. We base our software on Java and Web technologies. We do not only focus on high quality results but on delivering the best possible user experience. We are deeply convinced that customer satisfaction is the key for sustainable business.

At Karakun we believe in the tools we use and the solutions we offer. With a strong focus on open source based development we always aim at creating the best outcome for our customers while at the same time sharing our insights and knowledge with the community.

## Stay up to date
At Karakun, we mostly use open source projects and tools in our daily business. Since we strongly believe in open source we have a history of active contributions to many of these technologies.
To always be up-to-date, we attend high-profile conferences like JavaLand, Devoxx or Oracle Code One. Plus, we do internal hackathons and sponsor meetups like hackergarten or JUGs. On top of that we offer trainings for several modern technologies and topics - held by either Karakun staff or by internationally acclaimed experts.

We are  proud to be the home of several Java Champions, Java Rockstars and Java book authors. You  have the opportunity to work with them on your next projects. At Karakun our development teams are composed flexibly- without any hierarchies or fixed roles.
