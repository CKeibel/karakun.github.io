## Love where you work

At Karakun, weâ€™re looking for talented people to do work that they love at all levels of the company.

Karakun is a team of more than 30 very experienced software developers working together for many years.
The Karakun team is developing agilely custom solutions for enterprises based on Java and Web technologies providing the optimal user experience.

At Karakun we believe in the tools we use and the solutions we offer. With a strong focus on open source and open source
based solutions we always try to create the best reachable solutions for our customers and share our insights and
knowledge with the community.

## Stay up to date

At Karakun we mostly use open source projects and tools in our daily business. 
Since we love open source we already contributed back to many of these technologies.

To always be up to date we try to improve ourselves by visiting well known conferences like JavaLand, Devoxx or Oracle Code One.
Next to this we do internal hackathons and sponsor meetups like [hackergarten](http://hackergarten.net/) or JUGs.
On top of that we offer trainings for several modern technologies and topics by worldwide experts that can easily be attended by colleges.

Not only are we using cool technology we are also proud to be the home of several Java Champions, Java Rockstars and
Java book authors and you will have the opportunity to work with them on your next projects.
At Karakun we try to mix our development teams without creating any hierarchies or giving fixed roles.
