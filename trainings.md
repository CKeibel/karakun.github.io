## Our trainings and workshops
Being prepaired for the future is always a mission critical task for modern it companies. New technologies and
framework will be presented each year at tec conferences and the internet. By becoming more and more agile and
using cool tools and services the open source community is growing like never before and provides iterations of
new patterns, workflow and general rethinking how problems can be solved in a way that is much faster than even
5 years ago. To be prepaired for the future and learn what technologies should be used to create maintainable
and stable applications our experts at Karakun created a rich set of training curses and workshops.

## Workshops just made for you
Will all of our curses will be held several times a year at 3 different locations in Europe we love to offer them
as special in house trainings and workshops for companies. Here we can even dicuss specific problems in a more
concrete way than it would be possible in a mixed course with trainees from different companies. If you interested
in doing one of our workshops at your company [just contact us]((mailto:hendrik.ebbers@karakun.com)).

## Open Workshops
As already mentioned we provide our workshops and traings at 3 different locations:

* Karakun headquarter in Basel, Switzerland
* Karakun office in Dortmund, Germany
* Eppleton office in Munich, Germany

At all 3 locations we will do the training in a nice equipped room that let attendees concentrate at the content but
do not feel like beeing in a school class. All locations provide free wifi, softdrinks and snacks for the 
participants. Each training day contains a free lunch and at the end of a training day we like to offer a cold beer ;)

Oh, and we have a pro tip for all people that like dogs: In that case you should attend a training in our dog 
friendly office in Dortmund and use on of the breaks to play with one of our four-legged friends :)

## Our trainings
While we are always willing to offer individual workshops for companies we prepaired a set of courses that will help developers to create applications that are maintanable and use state of the art technologies and patterns. The following list contains an overview of the courses that we currently offer:
