We would like to let you know that the Rico project has put "on hold".

That means there is currently no further develoment or maintenance of the open source project and the provided components planned.

We are aware that there might be projects out there who built and rely upon Rico and we want to let you know that we donÂ´t just leave you alone. 
If you are affected by this change, please [reach out to us](mailto:rico@karakun.com). We are still here and still very eager to create great solutions - that still includes Rico if you ask for it!

On the other hand, if you just want to provide back to the community or share improvements you did, we would still happily look at and integrate merge requests.
The repositry and infrastructe will remain here and is open to be used.

So long, see you soon!
