[Rico](/rico) is an open-source application framework led by <span class="my-karakun">Karakun</span> to help building better solutions in less time.

We are happy to share with you the new release 1.1 of Rico ([Github](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico/releases/tag/1.1.0), [Bintray](https://bintray.com/beta/#/karakun/Rico/Rico/1.1.0?tab=releaseNotes)). With this release, we can provide full Java 11 compatibility and more:

## What's new?

* Java 11 compatibility (while still compatible with Java 8)
* JavaEE migrated to JakartaEE
* Spring Boot dependency updated to 2.2.6
* Keycloak updated to 9.0.3

* [rico-js](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-js/releases/tag/1.1.0): Updated Dependencies, small change in date-handling
  * now available via npm repository: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rico-projects/rico-js

* [rico-angular](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-angular/releases/tag/v1.0.7): Updated to use [rico-js](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-js/releases/tag/1.1.0) 1.1.0
 

We also updated our [samples](https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples) so you can use these as a reference.

## What does Java 11 compatiblity bring for you?

* de-tangles JavaFx from releases by Oracle 

* provides Java Module System support
* * clear, technically supported/enforced separation between public/private API 
* * hide transitive dependencies 


## Outlook

With this release we fulfill some of the steps planned with our roadmap. Next thing that will be addressed is some optimization of the Rico Remoting Protocol.

Have fun using Rico to build awesome solutions and don't hesitate to [get in touch!](mailto:rico@karakun.com).
