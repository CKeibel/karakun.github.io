Several Java Champions and other members of the community have written articles about the new Java release train and the general future of Java within the last year. Since there are still many rumours and wrong statements about that topic in the wild of the internet the Java Champions group decided to write an article that should clearify all issues.

Together with evengalists and employees of the main Java vendor companies like Oracle, Azul and so on the group collected all important information and facts. In an open document that is signed by many keyplayers of the business a developer can find all answers that he needs to plan workflow and strategies for Java based applications based on trhe changes in the ecosystem.

We (Karakun) contributed to this document and our previous articles were a good starting point to write the open document. We are really happy that we already had the change to help that many developers to get the critical knowlegde about Java in this first periode of the Karakun DevHub.

Well, since you are here to read the open document of the Java Champion group I don't want to detain you anymore ;) You can [find the document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nFGazvrCvHMZJgFstlbzoHjpAVwv5DEdnaBr_5pKuHo/preview).
