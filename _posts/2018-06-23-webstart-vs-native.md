title:  'Why a native bundle can not always replace Web Start based applications'
author: hendrik
featuredImage: jar-2
excerpt: "Starting with the release of Java 11 Web Start won't be anymore part of the Oracle JDK. Based on this several
companies migrate away from Web Start to the build of native bundles that provide a native executable which contains the
specific application and a JDK. While this is a very good approach in general the Web Start technology contains some
important features for enterprise that can't easily be replaced by a native bundle."
