**"Knock knock."**

**"Whoâ€™s there?"**

**"Java 11"**

The next version of Java (Java 11) will be released on the 25th September 2018. Several developers and companies plan to switch from
Java 8 to Java 11 within the next month. Since Java 9 and Java 10 were the 2 first version that are based on the new release train
of Oracle a lot of people assume a LTS (Long term support) release of Java 11 by Oracle that they can easily use the next year in
production.

While there are still some rumors and wrong assumtions about the new release train, the content of Java 11 and its pricing model we will have a deeper look at all this points in a series of blog posts.

In this first post we will have a general look at the release model and licence of Java 11 and any constraints that are based on this topics.

## Oracles new release and licence model for Java

When having a look at the current state of Java 11 you can already download an "early access" build. Here Oracle provides 2 different
types of builds: "OpenJDK builds" and "Oracle JDK builds"

![Current Java 11 early access downloads]({{ "/assets/posts/2018-07-24-open-jdk/download.png" | absolute_url }})

As you can see in the screenshot the 2 versions differ in the supported operation systems and the licence. Once Java 11 is released you will be able to download final release binaries for this 2 builds types. Based on this it will be important for every developer to know the difference between this 2 types. To be true there are no real difference in the functionallity of this builds. Both will be build based on the same sources (from OpenJDK) and will contain the same functions and Java APIs. The main differences will be the licence that defines how and when the build can be used and the future support of this 2 builds. While we already [publised a more detailed article]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-25-java-releases %}) about that topic and mentioned it in our [OpenJDK overview page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link jdks.md %}) I will just give a short summary:

**OpenJDK builds**
- This binaries are build based on OpenJDK
- Like earlier Java versions you can simply use this builds everywhere (for example on a cloud server in production)
- This builds will be supported for only 6 month per Java version. Based on this you will not get any Java 11 updates after 6 month for the OpenJDK builds from Oracle. If you want to get access to security updates and bugfixes you need to switch to Java 12 in March 2019

**Oracle JDK builds**
- This binaries are build based on OpenJDK
- If you do not refer commercial support by Oracle you must not use this builds in production. It's fine to use this builds for development and test environments but based on the licence it will be forbidden to use them in any productive environment (without a commercial licence)
- With a commercial lience you can download and use updates of Java 11 till 2023. Based on this you will get access to the so called LTS release of Java 11
- Without commercial support you will not get any Java 11 updates after 6 month for the Oracle JDK builds from Oracle. If you want to get access to security updates and bugfixes you need to switch to Java 12 in March 2019

Based on this information each developer needs to decide which Java builds he wants to download and use. Without knowing this information you maybe download a "Oracle JDK build" and use the binaries in production without having a commercial contract with Oracle. By doing so you will be guilty of an offence. On the other hand you need to know that the $free releases of Oracle won't be LTS releases. Therefore a developer that upgrades applications to the OpenJDK builds or Oracle can not rest for next years. After 6 month no security- and bugfix-releases will be offered by Oracle.

## Think out of the box
Since several years other vendors provide free and commercial builds for Java. Most developers will aready seen IBM, Azul or maybe Red Hat JDK somewhere in the wild. With the new Java release train most of this companies updated its strategy and business model for Java and provide several options next to the 2 mentioned builds from Oracle. In [our article about the price and support models for Java]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-25-java-releases %}) you can find a good overview of mostly all vendors. Based on your development workflows and future plans one of the Java builds from Azul, Sap and so on might be a better solution for you than the Oracle builds. Since all this builds are based on the same sources from OpenJDK and sucessfully passed the TCK you do not need be afraid to use them. Since the number of Java vendors will even become bigger based on the new Java release train any developer and company will find a release and licence model that fits to its internal needs. Once you found "the perfect Java" for your needs it's time to think again about creating cool applications, frameworks and architecture. 

Do not stress yourself with the changes in the Java ecosystem. Inform yourself about the alternatives next to Oracle within the next month and be prepaired for the bright future of Java. By doing so you can really be relaxed ;)

## Preview

Inb the next post we will have a look at some features and functionallity that was removed or has been changed between Java 8 and Java 11. Based on this we will see what kind of backward compatible Java 11 provides and how you can fix issues in that area.
