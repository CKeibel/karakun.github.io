Rumor: Java 11 is the next release that will supported longer than 6 month. Based on that several people wait for it.
Fact: Oracle Java 11 has a free periode of 6 month (and you can not use it in production). 
After that only commercial support

But: AdoptOpenJDK will provide free support for Java 11 for a longer time.
Based on that: Yes, you should definitelly migrate to Java 11.

Since Oracle JDK not allowed to use in production you should have a look at OpenJDK build if you do not have commercial licence.
