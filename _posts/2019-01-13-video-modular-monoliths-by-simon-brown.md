**Video:** [Modular Monoliths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKxmEeuvc4) (52 min)

**Speaker:** [Simon Brown](https://simonbrown.je)

**Conference:** [Devoxx Belgium 2016](https://devoxx.be/)

**Summary:**

First part looks at software architecture especially visualization of it. The C4 model is introduced as one way of visualization.
But mostly the code base will not reflect such diagrams. This is called the model-code gap.

In the second part different ways of structuring the code are presented and analyzed if they help to reduce the model-code gap.
This leads to better modularity in the code base.

Finally there is also a look at testability in such restructured code base.
Maybe we choose our units for testing too small.

**Key learnings:**

 * What to focus on when visualizing architecture.
 * How code can be structured differently.
 * How to profit from Micro Service ideas in a monolithic application
 * Increase maintainability of the code
 * A unit as in "unit test" sometimes is more than a single class
 * Make less classes and methods public
