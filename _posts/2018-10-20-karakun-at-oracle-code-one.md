This year Oracle does the first [Code One conference](https://www.oracle.com/code-one/index.html) in San Francisco. Code One is the sucessor of the famous JavaOne conference and will connect developers of different programming languages and backgrounds. Even with the changed name Java is still very important and huge at Code One and the conference offers an awesome opertunity for our Java exports to discuss the future of the ecosystem.
